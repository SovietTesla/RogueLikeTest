# RogueLikeTest
RogueLikeTest is a game created for Mr Dunlea's AP Computer Science A class Rancho Bernardo High School, 2017 by Nikolai Trintchouk, Ben Burdette, and Johnathan Knowles.
This game is meant to fit in the Roguelike genre of older games such as Rogue and Nethack.
It uses [trystan's AsciiPanel library](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel "AsciiPanel on Github") to imitate the command line of older systems which would have run these games.
